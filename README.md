# The Rijndael algorithm implemented in python
I wrote it purely for educational purposes to understand the inner workings of the algorithm. It's not meant to be used, so DON'T USE IT, because it's not secure.

I didn't use any libraries (like numpy), because I wanted write everything on my own to exercise.
